# Pacman AI ᗧ • • • 🍒

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of intelligent agents for the game Pacman. The primary goal was to develop search and decision-making algorithms to allow Pacman to win autonomously against ghosts, navigating through mazes efficiently.

This project highlights my ability to implement complex algorithms and solve logic-heavy problems.

## Key Algorithms & Features
I focused on implementing the following logic:
* **Search Algorithms:** Implementation of DFS (Depth First Search), BFS (Breadth First Search), and A* (A-Star) to find the optimal path to food dots.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Use of adversarial search algorithms (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning) to anticipate ghost movements and make safe decisions.
* **Heuristics:** Design of evaluation functions to optimize the agent's performance and score.

## Technologies
* **Language:** Python
* **Concepts:** Graph Theory, AI, Pathfinding, Data Structures

## How to run
python pacman.py
